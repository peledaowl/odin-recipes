    <h4>The ultimate test subject motivator - a mythical dessert promised after successfully completing a series of mind-bending puzzles, but as elusive as the meaning of life itself.</h4>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of flour (preferably not an ingredient from the "Combine" machine)</li>
        <li>1 cup of sugar (not extracted from an Aperture Science robot)</li>
        <li>1 cup of enriched non-self-aware chocolate</li>
        <li>1 cup of self-rising deadly neurotoxin (just kidding, use baking powder instead)</li>
        <li>1 cup of unsalted conspiracy (or unsalted butter)</li>
        <li>2 eggs (not from the "GLaDOS" poultry farm)</li>
        <li>1 cup of whole milk (from cows that haven't been through an experiment)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Recipe instructions:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your trustworthy, non-portal equipped oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (don't open any mysterious doors).</li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine the flour and sugar, making sure they have no hidden agenda.</li>
        <li>Add the chocolate but ensure it hasn't been genetically modified to shoot portals.</li>
        <li>Carefully stir in the baking powder (avoiding any glowing green substances).</li>
        <li>In a separate chamber, beat the eggs without the interference of any rogue AI.</li>
        <li>Melt the unsalted conspiracy (butter) and mix it into the eggs.</li>
        <li>Combine the egg mixture with the dry ingredients while watching out for rogue turrets.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the milk until the batter is as smooth as an Aperture Science personality sphere.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into a non-portal equipped cake pan.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30-35 minutes or until a fork, not a portal gun, can be inserted and comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Allow the cake to cool, resisting any urges to place a portal under it.</li>
        <li>Frost with a delicious, non-portal chocolate icing, and decorate with sprinkles (but don't use any companion cubes).</li>
        <li>Serve with a knowing smirk, and remember, the cake is not a lie - it's just not a sentient AI. Enjoy your portal-free dessert!</li>
    </ol>
