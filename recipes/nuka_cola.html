    <h4>The wasteland's favorite beverage - it's like regular cola, but with a delightful hint of radiation and a side of relentless bottle cap collection quests. Just remember, a warm Nuka-Cola may be tastier, but it won't heal your rads!</h4>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can of blue raspberry soda</li>
        <li>1 can of lemon-lime soda</li>
        <li>A few drops of blue food coloring (for that unmistakable radioactive glow)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of grenadine syrup (for that extra kick)</li>
        <li>Dry ice (to mimic the carbonation effect)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Recipe instructions:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Take your can of blue raspberry soda, and carefully add a few drops of blue food coloring <br> until it glows like it's fresh from the wasteland. Be sure not to go overboard, or you might end up with a radioactive surprise!</li>
        <li>Fill a glass halfway with your neon blue soda mixture, and then gently pour in your lemon-lime <br>soda to create that signature Nuka-Cola effervescence. Watch out for bubbles, they're even better than bottle caps!</li>
        <li>Drizzle the grenadine syrup on top, just like the blood of your enemies, but tastier! Give it <br>a little stir to get that perfect, radioactive hue.</li>
        <li>Add a small chunk of dry ice for that 'cooling effect' - literally. And remember, don't drink it<br> until the dry ice has fully evaporated unless you want to experience your very own mini nuclear explosion (which, let's be honest, might be fun).</li>
        <li>Garnish your mocktail with a cocktail umbrella and a maraschino cherry because even in the post-apocalypse, <br> can still enjoy the finer things in life.</li>
        <li>Serve with a side of Pip-Boy and a dash of quirky Vault-Tec humor. Enjoy your Nuka-Cola Quantum Mocktail,<br> and don't forget to check for hidden caps at the bottom of the glass!</li>
